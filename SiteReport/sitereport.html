   		<h1> Site Report </h1>
   		<p> Ever since I was a kid, I was fascinated by tech. When I was about 5 years old my Dad had brought a calculator from Japan. It was thick and had a huge screen with bunch of scientific symbols on it. That calculator came with a manual and there was a website for it. Later that day I went to my local cyber and I entered that website, usually I used to play games with my friends, but that day I was really curious what those letters "https" and symbols ". , /" meant. It took some time to load but I wasn't expecting that a website would be that good.
   		<br>
   		<br>
   		As you'd expect of a child I totally forgot about that one little experience but as I got older I again started to more curious about the workings of the Internet and how websites worked in general.
   		Later I decided to create a webpage by myself, I learned about computers and the basic functioning of a webpage and now because of that experience I have been learning about website and computers till today.
   		<br>
   		<br>
   		As I chose my career path in computer science I've assimilated knowledge and learned various programming languages and how to utilize it on developing a webpage.
   		<br>
   		<br>
   		There were definiltely many roadblocks I experienced while learning but it didn't hold be back beacuse of my curiosity and facination with web designing.
   		<br>
   		<br>
   		For this project I didn't know where to begin and was stuck thinking about the layout , design

   		<h1> My Module Experience </h1>
   		<p> This module and the project have both helped me tremendously! It has taught me not only about web development but how to research, how to be productive and write code which is easier to understand. Our module leader Mr. Ankit Thapa has made each and every one of us very clear and has taught all the necessary skills required to complete this project. 
   		<br>
   		<br>
   		Through his comprehensive and easy to understand teaching learning CSS was a breeze. The learning process has been very intreractive despite lockdown restrictions.

   		<h1> Building the Website </h1>
   		<p> This is a preety straghtforward and a simple webpage. As we had already discussed with our module leader and had already designed a rough sketch on how to start as just starting the web designing process can be very danting and often determines the end result of your website. 
   		<br>
   		<br>
   		Almost all the necessary syntaxes were already discussed so researching was effortless and didn't take much time. Watching various youtube tutorials and searching the errors or problems that came during the designing process through stackoverflow made this whole process efficient. 
   		<br>
   		<br>
   		As for the design choises goes, I wanted to make a minimalistic front page with few text and decided to use colors that were easy on the eyes to look at. As for other pages go I stuck with the main theme.
